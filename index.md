It's very easy to make some world **bold** and the other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

Sometimes you want numbered list:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a start
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub point, put two space before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

If you want to embed images, this is how to do it:

# Structured documents

Sometimes it's was useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start line with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote simpler heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading size.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway

There are many different ways to style to code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`. If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four space:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

And  if you like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

GitHub supports many extras in Markdown that help you reference and link to people. If you ever want to direct a comment at someone, you can prefix their name with a @ symbol: Hay @kneath â€” love your sweater!

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item

When you include a task list in the first comment of an Issue, you will see a helpful progress bar in your list of issues. It work in Pull Requests, too!

And, of course emoji!

# This is an `<h1>` tag
## This is an `<h2>` tag
###### This is an `<h6>` tag

*This text will be italic* <br>
_This text will also be italic_

**This text will be bold** <br>
__This text will also be bold__


_You **can** combine them_

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
  1. Item 3a
  1. Item 3b

As Kanye West said:

I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead.

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div: '#foo'})
  }
}
```

    function fancyAlert(arg) {
      if(arg) {
        $.facebox({div: '#foo'})
      }
    }

    def foo():
        if not bar:
            return True

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
